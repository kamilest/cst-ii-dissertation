Subject: Phase 1 - Stankeviciute: Prediction of Age using Graph Neural networks
(or Semi-Supervised Graph Convolutional Networks, or a combination/comparison)

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Kamile Stankeviciute

College: Gonville and Caius College

User Identifier: ks830

Director of Studies: Dr G. Titmus, Dr T. M. Jones

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.
The project is inspired by the ideas from two papers by Parisot
et al. involving classification of healthy controls and Alzheimer's/
Autism Spectrum Disorder patients using Graph Convolutional
Networks in a semi-supervised manner. 

This project will either reproduce and improve the results
presented in the paper for one of the datasets (ABIDE or ADNI), or apply
this idea to a different classification/regression problem on a different 
dataset (e.g. predicting age or another label from UK Biobank's brain 
imaging and other data).

The project could also compare this approach to other graph neural network
architectures such as Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate their robustness
by observing the changes in performance as more training data is removed.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.
Dr Tiago Azevedo, Prof Pietro Li√≤

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

I will need my own machine as well as the GPUs provided by the 
Computational Biology Group to increase the training speed of the 
neural networks.
