Subject: Phase 1 - Stankeviciute: Graph neural networks for age prediction from neuroimaging data

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Kamile Stankeviciute

College: Gonville and Caius College

User Identifier: ks830

Director of Studies: Dr G. Titmus, Dr T. M. Jones

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.
This project has been inspired by the ideas from two papers by Parisot
et al. involving semi-supervised classification of Alzheimer's and 
Autism Spectrum Disorder patients using Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs). 

In this project my aim will be to apply the same idea to the UK Biobank dataset where I will use structural and functional brain imaging data for an age regression task. 

I will also compare the performance of the GCN to another graph neural network
architecture such as the Graph Attention Network, and evaluate their robustness
by observing changes in performance as more training data is removed.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.
Tiago Azevedo, Alexander Campbell, Prof Pietro Li√≤

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

I will need my own machine as well as the GPUs provided by the 
Computational Biology Group to increase the neural network training speed. 

I will be given access to the UK Biobank data by Dr Richard Bethlehem from Department of Psychiatry.
