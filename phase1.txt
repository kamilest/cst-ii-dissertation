Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.


2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.
Dr Tiago Azevedo, Prof Pietro Li√≤

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

I will need my own machine as well as the GPUs provided by the 
Computational Biology Group to increase the training speed of the 
neural networks.
