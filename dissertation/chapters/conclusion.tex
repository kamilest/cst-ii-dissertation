\chapter{Conclusion}

% This chapter is likely to be very short and it may well refer back to the Introduction. It might properly explain how you would have planned the project if starting again with the benefit of hindsight.

\section{Successes and failures}

\section{The project in hindsight (lessons learnt)}
Lessons learnt: graph \textit{representation} is more important than the framework used. Good representations of the dataset can help guide the learning algorithm in the right way as it gets the intuitions faster just because of the way the data was represented in the first place. It's not good if it captures bias, but in this case representation made the difference between the model not learning anything and the model getting great results.

\section{Possible continuations of the project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Include DNA methylation data as it is widely used in other studies and is claimed to improve the predictive power of the model \cite{cole2018brain}.
\end{itemize}
