\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}
% This is where Assessors will be looking for signs of success and for evidence of thorough and systematic evaluation as discussed in Section 8.3. Sample output, tables of timings and photographs of workstation screens, oscilloscope traces or circuit boards may be included. A graph that does not indicate confidence intervals will generally leave a professional scientist with a negative impression.
% As with code, voluminous examples of sample output are usually best left to appendices or omitted altogether.
% There are some obvious questions which this chapter will address. How many of the original goals were achieved? Were they proved to have been achieved? Did the program, hardware, or theory really work?
% Assessors are well aware that large programs will very likely include some residual bugs. It should always be possible to demonstrate that a program works in simple cases and it is instructive to demonstrate how close it is to working in a really ambitious case.

This chapter presents the best-performing GCN and GAT models (Section~\ref{section:model-ranking}) and evaluates their performance (Section~\ref{section:test-set-performance}) against standard evaluation metrics (Section~\ref{section:evaluation-metrics}). It additionally analyses the significance of these results (Section~\ref{section:significance-testing}), the model robustness to population graph node noise (Section~\ref{section:node-noise}), and their dependence on population graph edges (Section~\ref{section:edge-noise}). Finally, it discusses these findings from a broader perspective (Section~\ref{section:discussion}).

\section{Model ranking and selection}
\label{section:model-ranking}
Following the hyperparameter tuning process described in Section~\ref{section:training-procedure}, the models were selected according to the following procedure (applied separately to the GCN and GAT model families):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, the models were ranked by ascending average MSE loss. The model with the lowest average MSE was chosen as the reference model.
    \item All models whose one standard deviation interval from their MSE did not overlap with the one standard deviation interval of the reference model MSE were excluded from ranking.
\end{enumerate}

The cross-validation performance of the best-scoring models selected by the above procedure is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:gat-gcn-rank}. The hyperparameters for each of the short-listed models are listed in Tables~\ref{table:shortlisted-gcn} and~\ref{table:shortlisted-gat} (Appendix~\ref{appendix:hyperparameters}).

\end{figure}

Although both best-ranked (reference) models (GCN1 and GAT1) have relatively high variance, they still seem to be the most promising and therefore have been selected for further evaluation. Their population graph specification and GNN architecture hyperparameters are listed in Table~\ref{table:best-hyperparameters}. While the hyperparameters for the two architectures are very different, it is hard to make a definite qualitative comparison between them because of high and not clearly systematic variation in hyperparameter combinations over all short-listed models (Appendix~\ref{appendix:hyperparameters}).

\section{Evaluation metrics}
\label{section:evaluation-metrics}
The main performance metrics used for most regression problems, including the brain age estimation task, are \textit{Pearson's correlation} and \textit{coefficient of determination}.

\subsubsection{Pearson's correlation}
For sets of true labels $\mathbf{y}  = [y_1 \dots y_N]$ with mean $\bar{y}$ and predicted labels $\mathbf{\hat{y}} = [\hat{y}_1 \dots \hat{y}_N]$, \textit{Pearson's correlation} is computed as

\begin{equation}
    r(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \frac{\mathrm{cov}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}{\sigma_{\mathbf{y}} \sigma_{\mathbf{\hat{y}}}},
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{cov}(\cdot, \cdot)$ denotes covariance and $\sigma$ stands for standard deviation. 

\subsubsection{Coefficient of determination}
The \textit{coefficient of determination} indicates how much variance in the features $\mathbf{X}$ could be explained by the model. It is computed as 
\begin{equation}
    r^2(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{\sum_{i} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}.
\end{equation}

Higher values for both metrics (with maximum 1) indicate a higher level of agreement between the true and predicted labels and therefore higher predictive power.


\section{Test set performance of selected models}
\label{section:test-set-performance}
Generally in literature, after using cross-validation for model selection, the model is retrained on the entire dataset before giving a point estimate on a hold-out test set~\cite{raschka2018model}. This is because training on more data, especially when the dataset is small, allows to learn more patterns and therefore give better predictions on the unseen data. However, in this project the validation set was also used for early stopping since neural networks are especially prone to overfitting~\cite{prechelt1998automatic}. Some investigation of the hyperparameter tuning has shown that applying the stopping criteria discussed in Section~\ref{section:training-procedure} on just the training set would have still led to convergence only after the model has already overfit on the unseen validation labels. On the other hand, it is unclear how the stopping criteria should be adjusted when the training set size increases. 

Considering that the UKB dataset is large and that retraining the model using more data but without early stopping might not pay off for the loss in generalisation, all cross-validation folds were kept for test set performance estimation. Table~\ref{table:test-performance} gives the hold-out test set estimates for the metrics discussed in Section~\ref{section:evaluation-metrics}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Test set performance of GCN1 and GAT1 models (over the five early stopping folds of the training set).}\label{table:test-performance}
    \centering
    \small
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
        \hline
    \textbf{Model} & MSE & $r$ & $r^2$ \\  \hline
        GCN1 & $28.045 \pm 0.595$ & $0.675 \pm 0.008$ & $0.445 \pm 0.010$ \\
        GAT1 & $27.543 \pm 0.758$ & $0.670 \pm 0.005$ & $0.477 \pm 0.008$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The following sections will consider a single fold of GCN1 and GAT1 models (having the same training/validation/test split) to ensure that any variation is due to the experimental setup and not the model weights or distributions of subjects across the folds. The fold was selected arbitrarily to be the first one returned by the stratified splitting procedure.

\section{Significance testing of model performance}
\label{section:significance-testing}
\subsection{Experimental setup}
A classical test for assessing whether the models have truly learnt the relationships between the input features and the response variable is called a \textit{permutation test}~\cite{ojala2010permutation}. The null hypothesis assumes that features and labels are independent (i.e.\ that there is no relationship between the neuroimaging and non-imaging data and brain age), and the distribution corresponding to this hypothesis is estimated by randomly permuting the labels in the dataset. The $p$-value for this test is computed as

\begin{equation}
    p = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \mathbf{1}\left[\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\hat{y}}, \pi(\mathbf{y})) \leq \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\hat{y}}, \mathbf{y})\right] + 1}{k+1}\label{eq:p-value}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the error function used to train the model (in this project MSE), $\pi(\cdot)$ is a function that uniformly at random returns a permutation of the argument, and $k$ is the number of samples.

In this project, $k=1000$ samples will be taken for each model family and the results will be claimed significant if the $p$-value in Equation~\eqref{eq:p-value} falls below the significance level $\alpha=0.05$. 

\subsection{Results}
The null distributions of GCN and GAT model errors with permuted labels are shown in Figure~\ref{figure:permutation-test}, with the MSE for the original dataset indicated by the red line.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{permutation_test.pdf}
    \caption{The null distribution of the label permutation test for GCN (left) and GAT (right) models. The red lines indicate MSE for the original dataset.}\label{figure:permutation-test}
\end{figure}

The $p$-values, representing how likely it is to get the MSE lower than the original dataset MSE purely by chance, were equal to $p=0.001$ for both GNN models. This is lower than the chosen significance level $\alpha=0.05$ so the null hypothesis is rejected and the performance of both models is statistically significant.


\section{GNN robustness to population graph node feature noise}
\label{section:node-noise}
A desirable property for real-world machine learning models is their robustness, here defined as tolerance to the noise and inconsistency in input data.
For population graphs trained on graph neural networks, this could be estimated by adding noise to an increasing proportion of nodes. 

\subsection{Experimental setup}
For the feature noise robustness evaluation, an increasing proportion of population graph nodes is corrupted by randomly permuting their features. Then the model is retrained and tested on the hold-out test set, measuring the change in performance. To make sure that any effect on the evaluation metrics is due to added noise and not the changing dataset splits, the model is trained on a single dataset split while the noise is added to different subjects. Moreover, to ensure that the effect on test set performance is due to the interaction with neighbourhoods and not due to the individual node features, only the nodes in the training set will be corrupted. For each of the GCN and GAT models, the experiment is repeated five times for each noise level (1\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 50\%, 80\%, and 95\% of training nodes).

\subsection{Results}

The results of node feature corruption on the predictive power of GNN models are shown in Figure~\ref{figure:node-noise}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{node_noise.pdf}
    \caption{The effect of permuting node features on $r$ (left) and $r^2$ (right) performance metrics, with error bars representing one standard deviation.}\label{figure:node-noise}
\end{figure}

As expected, for both GCN and GAT models the performance was decreasing relatively slowly as more training nodes got corrupted, and then dropped drastically when more than half of the training nodes had their features permuted. In case of the GAT model, the $r^2$ metric fell below 0 (bottom of Figure~\ref{figure:node-noise}), which means that no variance could be explained and that the mean of the observed subject ages in the dataset is a better estimate of the brain age than the predictions of the GAT model. 

% \subsection{Discussion}
% In practice, in a big and well-curated dataset such as the UK Biobank, the existence of exact protocols for equipment and measurement taking should prevent there being too many unacceptably noisy scans. Even in that case, the noise would take a milder form than the complete shuffling of features that make the node data meaningless. Having that considered, at low proportions of added noise, both models have been able to retain most of their predictive power, which could indicate their generalisability to new contexts.


\section{GNN dependence on population graph topology}
\label{section:edge-noise}
\subsection{Experimental setup}
The assumption behind the population graph model is that the edge structure helps to control for confounding effects while giving additional information useful for brain age prediction. One experiment to test this is to remove an increasing proportion of edges from the population graph (here the proportions of removed edges being the same as in the previous section). The training procedure is then repeated five times at each percentage of removed edges using a different random seed. The more edges are removed, the less neighbourhood structure the graph neural network models can exploit, having to rely on individual node features. 

\subsection{Results}
The effect of removing the edges on predictive power of the GNN models is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:edge-noise}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{edge_noise.pdf}
    \caption{The effect of removing edges on $r$ (left) and $r^2$ (right) performance metrics, with error bars representing one standard deviation.}\label{figure:edge-noise}
\end{figure}

Compared to the results in Section~\ref{section:node-noise}, where the predictive power drastically dropped with increased noise, the loss of information contained in edges and neighbourhoods of similar nodes did not affect the predictive power of the models. This could be inferred from the standard deviation intervals being quite wide for both evaluation metrics, overlapping across most, if not all, edge loss levels.

\section{Discussion}
\label{section:discussion}
The node noisification experiment shows that high levels of node corruption in the training set could drastically worsen the predictions for the uncorrupted test nodes. This result is expected because not only the noise could propagate to neighbourhoods, affecting individual predictions, but also because there is less useful training data available for the GNN architectures to learn from.
 
The edge removal experiment shows that the models relied more on the features of individual nodes rather than the graph structure defined by the similarity metrics. One explanation could be that the brain age depends more on the feature interactions within a single brain rather than the more universal signs of ageing; however, it seems more likely that the similarity metrics used (and the simple averaging technique to combine them) were not informative enough to allow for effective sharing of feature and label information. For example, the work by Parisot et al.~\cite{parisot2018disease}, which used population graphs to achieve state-of-the-art results in brain disorder classification, shows that results can vary significantly based on the selection of similarity features alone, with up to 20\% difference in mean accuracy scores. 

In literature on brain age estimation, many alternative models perform better than the proposed GNN models, including an XGBoost model in Kaufmann~et~al.~\cite{kaufmann2019} with $r=0.93$ (female) and $r=0.94$ (male), a § process regression model in Cole et al.~\cite{cole2018brain} with $r=0.94, r^2=0.88$, and similar results in a variety of models using the BrainAGE technique, summarised in Franke \& Gaser~\cite{franke2019ten}. However, these approaches often eliminate important confounding (e.g. sex and brain health) effects by fitting separate models, use very small (i.e. a few hundred people) and consequently less diverse datasets, and filter out low-quality scans. While this improves the performance, it might affect the applicability of these models to real clinical settings, where data quality is less consistent. 
The approach used in this dissertation aims for a more general solution by training a single model on a large, diverse, and minimally preprocessed dataset while having considerable resource (memory) and modelling (similarity metric) constraints. 

One advantage of the proposed population graph approach is its ability to model both imaging and non-imaging modalities for different sub-populations at once. This might be not as feasible or practical with alternative brain age prediction approaches (as it is harder to logically separate and to control the relative importance of the few non-imaging features among thousands of imaging features, if they are stored as a single vector), but might become more important with future advancements in neuroscience, growth of neuroimaging datasets, and growth in computational resources to support their processing. Addressing the GNN constraints outlined above, training on more data (while managing memory; UKB has more than doubled in size since the start of this project), incorporating additional (e.g. genetic~\cite{parisot2018disease}) modalities, and trying alternative state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures could give a much better picture of the potential of this approach.
