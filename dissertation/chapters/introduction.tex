Many of the common neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and multiple sclerosis, have been associated with the abnormal patterns of apparent ageing of the brain \cite{kaufmann2019}. This link has inspired numerous studies in estimation of the apparent brain age using brain imaging data \cite{franke2019ten}. The resulting \textit{brain age gap} biomarker, defined as the discrepancy between the brain age estimate and the actual chronological age, can be used to understand the biological pathways behind the ageing process, assess an individual’s risk for various brain disorders and identify new personalised treatment strategies.

Current state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for brain age gap estimation use structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DNA methylation data, considering each individual brain in isolation, often separating healthy controls from individuals with brain disorders, or developing separate models for each sex \cite{kaufmann2019,niu2019improved}. At the same time, due to high computational complexity and lack of available datasets, few studies consider patterns that are shared across the sub-groups of patients, other important brain imaging modalities such as functional MRI time-series data, and clinical expertise of neurologists and psychiatrists.

This dissertation aims to explore the effectiveness of the \textit{population graph} representation of patients in capturing the richness of a large-scale, population-wide neuroimaging dataset to estimate patients' brain age, and proposes a customisable end-to-end framework of graph neural network architectures – including graph convolutional \cite{kipf2017semi} and graph attention \cite{velickovic2018graph} networks – to train them. This is similar to the approach presented in Parisot et al. \cite{parisot2017spectral,parisot2018disease}, where population graphs are used to classify patients as healthy or having a disorder such as Alzheimer's or autism spectrum disorder. In those papers, the nodes of the population graph represent subject-specific neuroimaging data, and edges capture pairwise non-imaging similarities between the different subjects. 

Unlike in other state-of-the-art models, graph neural networks trained on population graphs have potential to learn from the entire cohort of healthy and affected patients of both sexes at once, capturing a wide range of confounding effects and detecting the variation in brain age trends of different sub-populations of subjects.


% \section{Related work}
% \subsection{Population graphs}
% Semisupervised population graphs in Parisot et al. for classifying healthy patients and patients having Mild Cognitive Impairment/Alzheimer's or autism spectrum disorder. These achieve state-of-the-art accuracies around 70\% even for a binary classification task which indicates that brain conditions are generally a complex task. Due to the different nature of the task and different evaluation metrics, this performance cannot be directly compared to the predictive power of the brain age regression task.

% \subsection{Graph neural networks}

% \subsection{Brain age prediction from neuroimaging data}
% Most of current machine learning-based methods for brain age gap prediction work on per-brain basis and do not consider pairwise similarities between patients, not taking into account the population as a whole.

% Graphs are static so it makes sense that most practical approaches would not use this as their model, because it prevents using applying it for new patients

% Kaufmann et al. \cite{kaufmann2019} uses gradient boosting based techniques (XGBoost) \cite{chen2016xgboost} for brain age gap prediction from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The study uses a significantly larger dataset of 45,000 people and presents separate models for female and male brain age gap prediction, without considering any pairwise similarities between individuals.

% Another framework for brain age gap prediction is based on Gaussian Processes regression, using raw T1-weighted MRI scans, segmenting them and using principal components analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction \cite{cole2018brain}.
