Many common neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis, have been associated with abnormal patterns of apparent ageing of the brain~\cite{kaufmann2019}. This link has inspired numerous studies in \textit{brain age estimation} using neuroimaging data~\cite{franke2019ten}. The \textit{brain age gap}, defined as the discrepancy between the estimated brain age and the true chronological age, is a powerful biomarker not only for understanding the biological pathways behind the ageing process, but also for assessing an individual’s risk to various brain disorders and identifying new personalised treatment strategies~\cite{tuncc2019deviation}.

Numerous studies exist applying machine learning algorithms to the problem of brain age estimation, typically using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic data~\cite{franke2019ten}. They tend to model healthy controls separately from individuals with brain disorders, and often develop separate models for each sex~\cite{kaufmann2019,niu2019improved} without explicitly considering potential variation in ageing patterns across different subgroups of subjects. Moreover, these studies rarely include other important brain imaging modalities such as functional MRI (fMRI) time-series data, or clinical expertise of neurologists and psychiatrists, even though a combination of different modalities has been shown to improve the results~\cite{niu2019improved}. 

This dissertation proposes a pipeline that can flexibly combine the richness of minimally preprocessed neuroimaging and non-imaging modalities to predict brain age in a clinically relevant fashion. The modalities are combined using the \textit{population graph} representation of patients. In the population graph, the nodes contain subject-specific neuroimaging data, and edges capture pairwise subject similarities of non-imaging data. In addition to controlling for confounding effects, these similarities help to exploit neighbourhood information when predicting node labels – an approach that has successfully been applied to a variety of problems in both medical and non-medical domains~\cite{parisot2018disease, tong2017multi, wang2017multi}. 

The population graph is used as input to two types of neural networks that can operate on graph-structured data~– the \textit{graph convolutional}~\cite{kipf2017semi} and the \textit{graph attention}~\cite{velickovic2018graph} networks~– to predict the brain age. This is similar to the approach of Parisot et al.~\cite{parisot2017spectral,parisot2018disease}, where population graphs are used to classify patients as healthy or suffering from a brain disorder (i.e. autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease).

Unlike in other state-of-the-art models, graph neural networks trained on population graphs have the potential to learn from the entire cohort of healthy and affected subjects of both sexes at once, capturing a wide range of confounding effects~\cite{ruigrok2014meta, lancet2016sex} and detecting the variation in brain age trends of different sub-populations of subjects. 

 
 

% \section{Related work}
% \subsection{Population graphs}
% Semisupervised population graphs in Parisot et al. for classifying healthy patients and patients having Mild Cognitive Impairment/Alzheimer's or autism spectrum disorder. These achieve state-of-the-art accuracies around 70\% even for a binary classification task which indicates that brain conditions are generally a complex task. Due to the different nature of the task and different evaluation metrics, this performance cannot be directly compared to the predictive power of the brain age regression task.

% \subsection{Graph neural networks}

% \subsection{Brain age prediction from neuroimaging data}
% Most of current machine learning-based methods for brain age gap prediction work on per-brain basis and do not consider pairwise similarities between patients, not taking into account the population as a whole.

% Graphs are static so it makes sense that most practical approaches would not use this as their model, because it prevents using applying it for new patients

% Kaufmann et al.~\cite{kaufmann2019} uses gradient boosting based techniques (XGBoost)~\cite{chen2016xgboost} for brain age gap prediction from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The study uses a significantly larger dataset of 45,000 people and presents separate models for female and male brain age gap prediction, without considering any pairwise similarities between individuals.

% Another framework for brain age gap prediction is based on Gaussian Processes regression, using raw T1-weighted MRI scans, segmenting them and using principal components analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction~\cite{cole2018brain}.
