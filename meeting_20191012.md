* generalisation—skyrocketing visibility
* "library for preprocessing the data"
  * interesting from CS perspective
  * everybody is complaining, working on specific dataset
  * each person does different preprocessing, different normalisation
* doing something modular, applying for one type of the module and have the main core—pipeline
  * some subclasses but not all of them—perhaps those relevant to the dataset I will be processing:
    * start from preprocessing of some dataset—"but I tried to also generalise that"
    * can later accommodate other choices better
    * could be a platform that someone can attach more things
